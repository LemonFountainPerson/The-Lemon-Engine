# The-Lemon-Engine
A basic 2D game engine being made in pure C with minimal dependencies: SDL3, standard C library (C99) and stb_image.h. Primarily being developed as a self-learning experience, but I intend to ensure that the codebase is usable and easily extensible. Documentation will be accurate to the latest version release, but may not be for smaller updates.
